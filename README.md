# Agent-based modelling

The following project represents a simple agent-based model. It has been developed in Spyder IDE and the final result can be found in Practical 9. The rest of the files represent the progress of the code developing as per each practical in the [GEOG5995 course](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/).

In order for the model to work in a simple GUI, the Graphics in the IPython console needs to be set to Tkinter. You can do this by clicking on the Tools > Preferences > IPython Console > Graphics and from the backend drop-down list, Tkinter must be selected. Restart the console and then the code should run.
